<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
<p> This game is a fun way to build memory muscle and can be played by most anyone! It was certainly one of my favorite games as a child. Back then we called it...Go Fish! </p>
